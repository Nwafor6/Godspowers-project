             <h3>How much does a typical project cost?</h3>
             <p>This is a difficult question to answer. Project cost depends on a number of things including the type of project, timeframe, and the specifics. You can, however, get a free quote by filling in this simple <span><a href="project-planner.html">project planner.</a></span></p>
             <h3>Will you work with my company on a long-term basis?</h3>
             <p>Yes. Not only do we work with companies on one-off projects, but we also like to think of ourselves as your strategic design partner and can work with your company over the long run to do our best to ensure you keep a consistent brand image and continually meet all of your marketing and growth goals.</p>
             
             <h3>What types of clients does Dreal Technologies work with?</h3>
             <p>We work with companies both large and small, as well as individuals from all over the world. We enjoy working with companies and organizations that are trying to make a difference in a positive way, as well as clients who are conscious of their impact on the world.</p>
             
             <h3>what is your design process</h3>
             <p>It varies from project to project, but it always starts with a meet and greet in person, over the phone, through Skype or email, or any way that works best for you. Depending on your specific needs, we’ll have meetings on strategy, concepts, etc to ensure that we are able to layout the most effective plan for your project. From there, we will continue on throughout our process which includes thoroughly getting to know your organization, extensive research, conceptualization, and collaboration. Throughout the process, we’ll include your team as much as you like so that we always have open communication and are always on the same page.</p>
             
             <h3>How do I get started working with you?</h3>
             <p><span><a href="contact.html">You can simply call or email us</a></span>, but the best way to get started with a project is to fill out the project planner. Once initial contact has been made, we’ll get to know each other and make sure we’re a good fit. From there, we’ll review the details of the project and map out an overall plan.</p>
             
             <h3>are you hiring</h3>
             <p>We are always on the lookout for talented people to work with.</p>
             <h3>Where is your company based?
